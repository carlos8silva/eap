line 1 with a variable: ${var}
#list(a-list)
line 2 is part of a list of items; this is item number ${i}!
#last
and item ${i} is the last item
#endlist
line 3
#if(an-if)
line 4 only appears if the if is true
#else
otherwise, you see this thing instead: ${thing}
#endif
let's now see a list within a list:
#list(people)
person {
    name: ${name}
    #if(male)
    gender: male
    #else
    gender: female
    #endif
    #list(children)
    child: ${child-name}
    #endlist
}
#endlist
end of the file

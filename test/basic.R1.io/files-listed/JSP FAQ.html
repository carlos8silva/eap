<font size="+1"><b>General FAQ</b></font> </p>
<p><a name="1"><b>What is JavaServer Pages technology?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology provides a simplified, fast way to create 
  web pages that display dynamically-generated content. The JSP specification, 
  developed through an industry-wide initiative led by Sun Microsystems, defines 
  the interaction between the server and the JSP page, and describes the format 
  and syntax of the page. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="2"><b>How does the JavaServer Pages technology work?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>JSP pages use XML tags and scriptlets written in the Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 
  programming language to encapsulate the logic that generates the content for 
  the page. It passes any formatting (HTML or XML) tags directly back to the 
  response page. In this way, JSP pages separate the page logic from its design 
  and display. </p>
  <p>JSP technology is part of the Java technology family; it uses a Java 
  programming language-based scripting language, and JSP pages are compiled into 
  servlets. JSP pages may call JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 
  components (beans) or Enterprise JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 
  components (enterprise beans) to perform processing on the server. As such, 
  JSP technology is a key component in a highly scalable architecture for 
  web-based applications. </p>
  <p>JSP pages are not restricted to any specific platform or web server. The 
  JSP specification represents a broad spectrum of industry input. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="3"><b>What is a servlet?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A servlet is a program written in the Java programming language that runs 
  on the server, as opposed to the browser (applets). Detailed information can 
  be found at <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet">
  http://java.sun.com/products/servlet</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="4"><b>Why do I need JSP technology if I already have servlets?</b></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>JSP pages are compiled into servlets, so theoretically you could write 
  servlets to support your web-based applications. However, JSP technology was 
  designed to simplify the process of creating pages by separating web 
  presentation from web content. In many applications, the response sent to the 
  client is a combination of template data and dynamically-generated data. In 
  this situation, it is much easier to work with JSP pages than to do everything 
  with servlets. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="5"><b>Where can I get the most current version of the JSP 
specification?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The JavaServer Pages 1.1 specification is available for download from
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/download.html#specs">here</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="6"><b>How does the JSP specification relate to the Java 2 Platform, 
Enterprise Edition?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The JSP 1.1 specification is an important part of the
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/">Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition 1.2</a>. 
  Using JSP and Enterprise JavaBeans technologies together is a great way to 
  implement distributed enterprise applications with web-based front ends. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="7"><b>Which web servers support JSP technology?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are a number of JSP technology implementations for different web 
  servers. The latest information on officially-announced support can be found 
  at <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/industry.html">
  http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/industry.html</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="8"><b>Is Sun providing a reference implementation for the JSP 
specification?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A reference implementation of JSP 1.1 is part of the
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/download.html#downloads">J2EE SDK</a>. 
  Tomcat, a free, open-source implementation of Java Servlet and JavaServer 
  Pages technologies is developed under the Jakarta project at the Apache 
  Software Foundation and can be downloaded free of charge from
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html">
  http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="9"><b>How is JSP technology different from other products?</b></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>JSP technology is the result of industry collaboration and is designed to 
  be an open, industry-standard method supporting numerous servers, browsers and 
  tools. JSP technology speeds development with reusable components and tags, 
  instead of relying heavily on scripting within the page itself. All JSP 
  implementations support a Java programming language-based scripting language, 
  which provides inherent scalability and support for complex operations. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="10"><b>Where do I get more information on JSP technology?</b></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The first place to check for information on JSP technology is
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/</a>. 
  This site includes numerous resources, as well as pointers to mailing lists 
  and discussion groups for JSP technology-related topics. </p>

<font size="+1"><b>Technical FAQ</b></font> </p>
<p><a name="11"><b>What is a JSP page?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A JSP page is a page created by the web developer that includes JSP 
  technology-specific tags, declarations, and possibly scriptlets, in 
  combination with other static (HTML or XML) tags. A JSP page has the extension 
  .jsp; this signals to the web server that the JSP engine will process elements 
  on this page. </p>
  <p>The exact format of a JSP page is described in the JSP specification.. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="12"><b>How do JSP pages work?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A JSP engine interprets tags and scriptlets, and generates the content 
  required - for example, by calling a bean, accessing a database with the JDBC<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 
  API or including a file. It then sends the results back in the form of an HTML 
  (or XML) page to the browser. The logic that generates the content is 
  encapsulated in tags and beans processed on the server. JSP scriptlets let 
  developers tie everything together, and ordinary HTML tags control the 
  formatting and display of the generated page. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="13"><b>Does JSP technology require the use of other Java platform 
APIs?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>JSP pages are typically compiled into Java platform servlet classes. As a 
  result, JSP pages require a Java virtual machine that supports the Java 
  platform servlet specification. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="14"><b>How is a JSP page invoked and compiled?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Pages built using JSP technology are typically implemented using a 
  translation phase that is performed once, the first time the page is called. 
  The page is compiled into a Java Servlet class and remains in server memory, 
  so subsequent calls to the page have very fast response times. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="15"><b>What scripting languages can I use with JSP technology?</b></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some JSP engines may support other languages, but the JSP 1.1 specification 
  only specifies a scripting language based on the Java programming language.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="15.1"><b>What is the syntax for JavaServer Pages technology?</b></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The syntax card can be
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/technical.html#syntax">viewed</a> or
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/pdf/card11.pdf">downloaded</a> from 
  our website. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="16"><b>Can I create XML pages using JSP technology?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, the JSP specification does support creation of XML documents. For 
  simple XML generation, the XML tags may be included as static template 
  portions of the JSP page. Dynamic generation of XML tags occurs through bean 
  components or custom tags that generate XML output. See the white paper <i>
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/html/JSPXML.html">Developing XML 
  Solutions with JavaServer Pages Technology</a></i> (<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/pdf/JSPXML.pdf">PDF</a>) 
  for details. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="17"><b>Can I generate and manipulate JSP pages using XML tools?</b></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The JSP 1.1 specification describes a mapping between JSP pages and XML 
  documents.The mapping enables the creation and manipulation of JSP pages using 
  XML tools. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="18"><b>How do I use JavaBeans components (beans) from a JSP page?</b></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The JSP specification includes standard tags for bean use and manipulation. 
  The <code>useBean</code> tag creates an instance of a specific JavaBeans class. 
  If the instance already exists, it is retrieved. Otherwise, it is created. The
  <code>setProperty</code> and <code>getProperty</code> tags let you manipulate 
  properties of the given object. These tags are described in more detail in the 
  JSP specification and tutorial. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="19"><b>What does the JSP 1.1 specification include?</b></a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The main new feature of the JSP 1.1 specification is a tag extension 
  mechanism for creating custom tags. Custom tags are bundled into
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/taglibraries.html">tag libraries</a>.
  </p>
